This project utilizes machine learning to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset is preprocessed by renaming columns, handling null values, and removing duplicates. Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize the distribution of spam and ham messages. Text features are extracted using TfidfVectorizer, converting text into numerical representations for analysis. Models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in natural language processing to solve real-world classification problems.
